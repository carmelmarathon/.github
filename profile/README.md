Come to Carmel, Indiana, voted one of the best small town suburbs in the US. Our unique race-day format includes all race distances utilizing the same start AND finish line! This allows participants to arrive, prepare and start together then easily find each other at the finish. Marathon and half marathon runners start together in the south two lanes with the 10K and 5K together in the north two lanes of City Center Boulevard.

The four lanes are separated by a grass medium for 300 yards until the first turn where the courses turn in opposite directions. The official start/finish area and all race activities are located next to the Palladium Music Center, at the corner of 3rd Avenue and City Center Drive. Free parking, beer garden and more. Join us!
